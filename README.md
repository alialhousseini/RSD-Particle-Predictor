# Particle Position Prediction in RSD - Data Science Pipeline

## Project Overview
This repository contains my work - [Username1](https://github.com/username1) - Provided initial project idea and data analysis. and  on a data science project for predicting the positions of particles (e.g., electrons) as they pass through a Resistive Silicon Detector (RSD). The project aims to build a robust predictive model to accurately determine the (x, y) coordinates of particle events based on signal measurements from the detector's pads.

### Problem Statement
Brief description of the problem, including the nature of the data and the specific challenge of predicting the particle positions.

### Dataset
A summary of the dataset used, including the number of events and the types of signal features (like magnitude, area, delay, etc.). Provide a link to the dataset if publicly available or a description if not.

## Repository Structure
Provide an overview of the repository's structure. Example:

    ├── data                   # Directory containing the dataset
    ├── notebooks              # Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis and models
    ├── src                    # Source code for the project
    ├── results                # Results and visualizations generated from the models
    ├── LICENSE
    └── README.md

(Adjust the above structure based on your repository's actual content.)

## Installation and Usage
